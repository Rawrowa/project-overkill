# The whole thing is pretty slow, it takes around 0.5s to save 1080p screenshot, and additional 1s to get a reply from the LLM
# If multiple screenshots were taken in a span of a second and the process is fresh (PID updates every launch), the LLM will be prompted every time
# The screen should be captured right away, before all the slow silly stuff
